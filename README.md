# Make-your-game

This project is our take on the classic arcade game Space Invaders

## Features

- 

## Objectives
- Game runs at at least 60 FPS at all times
- No frame drops!
- Proper use of RequestAnimationFrame
- It is very hard to predict performances in JS. So measure performances to see if your code is fast. This will be tested!
- Pause menu, that includes:
- Continue
- Restart
- A score board that displays the following metrics:
- Countdown clock or Timer that will indicate the amount of time the player has until the game ends or the time that the game has been running
- Score that will display the current score (XP or points)
- Lives that shows the number of lives that the player has left
- The use of layers must be minimal but not zero in order to optimize the rendering performance.
- You must not use frameworks or canvas, the game must be implemented using plain JS/DOM and HTML only

## Instructions

- Animation must have consistent motion through achieving 60 FPS.

- In order to play the game, the player must only use the keyboard. 

- Controls must be smooth, in other words, players should not need to spam a key to take actions in the game. 
Instead, for example, if a key is kept pressed, the player must continue to do the relevant action until released.

- Motions triggered by a key must not jank or stutter.

- Pause menu should allow players to pause, restart, and continue the game whenever. Pausing should not cause frame drops.
